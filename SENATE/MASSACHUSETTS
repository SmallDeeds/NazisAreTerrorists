SENATE RESOLUTION

    WHEREAS, The tragic events that took place on August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia prove that white nationalism and neo-Nazism remain very real threats to social and racial progress; and

    WHEREAS, Throughout the course of our nation’s history, white nationalism has promoted intimidation and violent repression of individuals solely on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, secual orientation, and immigration status; and

    WHEREAS, Today, white nationalism has attempted to reinvent itself, self-identifying as the “Alt-Right”, yet their present-day rhetoric and terrorism conjure painful memories of our nation’s past; and

    WHEREAS, While free speech is a bedrock value of Americans, white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups promote agendas that are in irreconcilable conflict with our nation’s foundational principles of liberty and justice for all; and

    WHEREAS, White nationalism and neo-Nazism are continuing to grow as menaces to societal order that seek to reignite social animosities, reverse improvements in race relations, divide the nation, and foment hatred, classism, and ethnic eradication; and

    WHEREAS, The white nationalist and neo-Nazi message of racial and social intolerance has led to senseless acts of violence that continue to terrorize members of ethnic and religious minority communities; therefore, be it

    RESOLVED, BY THE SENATE OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, that we strongly denounce and oppose the totalitarian impulses, violent terrorism, xenophobic biases, and bigoted ideologies that are promoted by white nationalists and neo-Nazis; and be it further

    RESOLVED, That we urge law enforcement to recognize these white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups as terrorist organizations, and to pursue the criminal elements of these domestic terrorist organizations in the same manner and with the same fervor used to protect the United States from other manifestations of terrorism; and be it further

    RESOLVED, That suitable copies of this resolution be delivered to the President of the United States, all members of the United States Senate, all members of the United States House of Representatives, the Governor of the State of Massachusetts, and all members of the Massachusetts General Assembly.
