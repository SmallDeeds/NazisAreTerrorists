    WHEREAS, One of the foundational principles of America and the strengths of our great democracy is our diversity of thought, ideas, and people; we are a country where men and women of different races, faiths, sexual orientations, and political beliefs are united under the banner of the greatest country in the world, the United States of America; and

    WHEREAS, The Washington House of Representatives and the people of the State of Washington mourn the victims of the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia and stand unified in our condemnation of the hatred espoused by the hundreds of white supremacists in Charlottesville; and

    WHEREAS, While the House of Representatives is resolute in its support for the free speech rights of Americans, it will not ignore or condone hate speech or violence committed by hate groups or anyone seeking to commit acts of domestic terrorism against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities or other classes of protected individuals as was the case in Charlottesville; and

    WHEREAS, The House of Representatives mourns the death of Heather Heyer and wishes a speedy recovery to the dozens who were injured by an individual who sought to silence different voices who chose to stand up to show that hate will never win out over love and the true American spirit; and

    RESOLVED, That we celebrate the diversity of our State and nation; and be it further
