# NazisAreTerrorists

## Overview

After World War II, the Nazi scourge had been overcome and the world was able
to rebuild and hopefully squash all the hatred and ignorance that the regime had
hoped to spread. Unfortunately, this effort lost steam slowly over the years.
Now with the tragic events that took place on August 12, 2017 in
Charlottesville, Virginia it has become apparent that the cool flame to eradicate
the world of these xenophobic ideologies must be stoked. It is clear from the
actions taken that day, the people that accept these intolerant views will
resort to acts of terrorism to spread their message and achieve their goals.
Though it should have been obvious from WWII, we live in a time that it's
better to be clear and redunant than misunderstood, let it known that
\#NazisAreTerrorists.

On THE NEXT DAY after the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, Illinois Senator
Don Harmon filed a Senate resolution to condemn neo-Nazis as terrorists. The
Illinois Senate adopted the resolution and the Illinois House soon followed
suit adopting a similar House resolution.

With the groundwork laid by the Senators and Representatives of the state of
Illinois, it is now our turn to make it known that Nazis and their ideologies
never have been, never are, and never will be welcome in America. We need to
to show the world and ourselves that \#NazisAreTerrorists.

## Call To Action

Using the Illinois resolutions as templates, you'll find two folders, HOUSE
and SENATE, that contain resolutions named with their respective state's name.
Email/call your local representative and ask them to sponsor the HOUSE and/or
SENATE resolution. If the first resolution can be adopted in one day the next
day, there's no reason we can't have the rest of the states soon after.
